/**
 * Defines an image to be used as the icon or shadow for a Marker. 'origin' and
 * 'size' are used to select a segment of a sprite image and 'anchor' overrides
 * the position of the anchor point from its default bottom middle position. The
 * anchor of an image is the pixel to which the system refers in tracking the
 * image's position. By default, the anchor is set to the bottom middle of the
 * image (coordinates width/2, height). So when a marker is placed at a given
 * LatLng, the pixel defined as the anchor is positioned at the specified LatLng.
 * The MarkerImage cannot be changed once constructed.
