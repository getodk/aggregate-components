This directory contains a simple example for how to run an
openid4java-based OpenID Relying Party on Google AppEngine.

First, create the WAR directory:

$ mvn package

Now, test the server locally:

$ $PATH_TO_APPENGINE/dev_appserver.sh -a <your-host-name> -p 8080 \
  target/appengine-consumer

Point your browser to http://<your-host-name>:8080 to test.

Finally, to deploy on AppEngine, you have to first claim an application
name for yourself, and then edit the configuration file
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml. Change the name of the
application from "openid4java" to the name you own. Then, rebuild and
upload the application: 

$ mvn package
$ $PATH_TO_APPENGINE/appcfg.sh update target/appengine-consumer
